google-home-apis-dev-challenge-entry 

This is my first time to create an app and I am so glad that I can make it under the google home developers challenge. 

Things to note for improvement of app: 
- Some recipe that are provided by gemini may not be provided by the spoonacular API. Can be improved by increasing recipe databare or implementing semantic searching since the recipe name maybe different with the spoonacular database.
  
- Controlling of smart appliances can be given their own interface for easier controlling similar to the google home example app.

- Increasing the basis of prompts for getting the meals from gemini. For example mood based meals (Meals to uplift the mood or Meals good for tough times) and event type meals (Meals good for date night or Meals good for movie night).
